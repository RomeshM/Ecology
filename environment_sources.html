                <p class="p1">
                    Pollution is the introduction of harmful materials into the environment.
                    These harmful materials are called pollutants. Pollutants can be natural, such as volcanic ash. 
                    They can also be created by human activity, such as trash or runoff produced by factories.

                <p>
                   <b>Cars spew pollutants from</b> <br> Their exhaust pipes. Burning coal to create electricity pollutes the air.
                    Industries and homes generate garbage and sewage that can pollute the land and water.
                    Pesticides—chemical poisons used to kill weeds and insects—seep into waterways and harm wildlife.

                <p>
                    Air pollution can directly contaminate the surface of bodies of water and soil. 
                    This can kill crops or reduce their yield. It can kill young trees and other plants. 
                    Sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide particles in the air, can create acid rain when they mix with water and oxygen in the atmosphere.
